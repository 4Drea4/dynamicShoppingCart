#### Reflection Questions

1. How did you dynamically create and append new elements to the DOM?
I appended the children then displayed them in my list.

2. What steps did you take to ensure accurate updates to the total price?
I plan on doing event cases and testing various amounts.

3. How did you handle invalid input for product name or price?
I collected the input as strings and obtained the value. I also had issues when I didnt call totalPrice and didnt pass in the amount entered into the total price so I can stop going in negative amounts. 

4. What challenges did you face when implementing the remove functionality?
I did not quite understand the syntax, I struggled to implement event delegation into this project.
