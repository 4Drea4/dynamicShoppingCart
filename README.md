#### Reflection Questions

1. How did you dynamically create and append new elements to the DOM?
2. What steps did you take to ensure accurate updates to the total price?
3. How did you handle invalid input for product name or price?
4. What challenges did you face when implementing the remove functionality?



### Disclaimer:
Eduart so graciously helped me with understanding the code a bit better.
